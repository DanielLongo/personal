                  projects below.) It has protected me against legal action, allowed me to build a brand for my sites,
                  and
                  eased the process of receiving tax-deductible financial donations.</li>
                <li>Politiwatch is an American 501(c)(3) nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for freedom
                  of
                  information, digital privacy rights, and political accountability. It was founded in 2016 with the
                  goal
                  of combating political ignorance, promoting privacy, and making civic information more accessible.
