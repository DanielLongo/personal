Not happy with American Express. Due to a glitch, they double billed me this month’s statement balance. I only keep the bare minimum amount of money in my checking account b/c interest is so low, so this caused an overdraft. I call them to see if they will credit me for $25 (the overdraft amount). “The charge didn’t come from us, so we can’t refund it.” Of course the charge didn’t come from you!
