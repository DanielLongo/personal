Built a neural net to classify pictures with cows from scratch in Java (didn't use any libraries). 

This was a great exercise since I to code everything from simple array arithmetic operations like dot products to organizing and connecting the classes made for arrays, models, and trainers.  

Also added a GUI client.  

If curious the code is on git <a href="https://github.com/DanielLongo/JavaNN" target="_blank">https://github.com/DanielLongo/JavaNN</a>
