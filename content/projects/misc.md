#### Other things I've built     

##### Pulse
Automated wellness checks for students sent via SMS. Proactively reaches out to students and connects them with help. Not deployed due to privacy concerns and liability issues.

##### Scantoad
Make your own Scantron, grade it with your phone camera, grades automatically submitted to LMS.

Teachers can print out answer sheets, students fill them out, and then with their phone teachers scan the answer sheets. Tests are graded (uses computer vision to recognize handwriting for free response) and grades are automatically added to the electornic grade book.  

This projects was a little too ambitious for the time we had. Had difficulties with iPhone overheating with tensorflow-lite on client. 

##### A silly unity game
