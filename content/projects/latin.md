We present QuisEst, a machine learning enabled tool that allows for style analysis and author identification of Latin texts. While a vast trove of text data survives from Roman antiquity, few efforts have applied machine learning techniques to analyze textual data on a large scale. Using a machine learning model and training on Latin texts ranging from Republic to Early Silver periods, a model was created that is able to detect patterns of an author's word usage. This model was utilized to identify authors of texts with disputed authorship.
