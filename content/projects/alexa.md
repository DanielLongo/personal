This project is very much a work in progress. It builds off my work in three classes from this past quarter (W 22): *Discourse Theory and Its Applications*, *Foundations of Product Realization*, and *Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning*.  

Currently, working on how a listening device can provide insights to teachers or be helpful for students.
