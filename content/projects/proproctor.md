This project was part of BaseHacks, my first Hackathon every!  

We built a chrome plugin that monitors activity while exams are being taken online. Because we offer a plugin, our tool is very flexible and can be used with any online testing service (assuming it's in browser).  

Also, experimented with some slightly creepy eye tracking to ensure students were keeping their eyes on their own screen, but this never made it into the MVP.  

The project however was short-lived, as we soon discovered exploits (turns out chrome plugins don't have enough access to truly monitor everything going on in a device).
