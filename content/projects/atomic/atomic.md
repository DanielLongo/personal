As part of Frontier Hacks 2019, I along with a team of three others built a rapidly deployable low cost mesh communications network that can function off the grid. Using solar-powered RaspberryPis we built wifi enabled nodes that can connect over long range radio. These nodes enable low-bandwidth communication such as messaging and online forms. They interface with users via wifi.
