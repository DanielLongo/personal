Some of my friends spend hours on end talking about shoes and searching for their next purchase. These conversations inspired me to create Swoop.  

The app aggregates shoes from StockX and Goat and then using disentagled VAEs creates embeddings creating a 'shoe manifold.'  

Shoes are displayed in the feed where users can like or save items and see what their friends thought of given items. Shoes similar to those liked by a given user and their friends appear in the feed.  

Frontend in React, backend in Flask (hosted on AWS EBS), ML done in Pytorch.
