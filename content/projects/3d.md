The development process for a AAA video game takes around five years, during my internship at NCSoft (Korean gaming company) I was tasked with expediting this process using ML.  

I developed a 3D model search engine that utilizes hand drawn sketches as queries. These sketch queries are quick to draw and better describe the features of an object than text queries.  

Used siamese networks and triplet networks to create common embedding spaces between sketches and 3D models. Frontend build with React, backend in FastAPI.
