We are building a human-in-the-loop solution for moderating user-generated content. We train ML models on content from customer applications to create filters that enforce platform-specific guidelines. We also provide a plug-and-play user reporting flow for applications that connects with our moderator dashboard.

Started as part of TreeHacks 2022 where the project won the Safety and Security Grand Prize.
