Every once in awhile, I'll be so excited about something that I'll want to share it with you, too. This might be a new project, something I've come across, or (rarely) a new post. I expect to send a letter roughly once a quarter or less; I certainly won't be crowding up your inbox.

If this is something you're interested in, sign up using the form below.

<hr class="sep h-1">
<div class="aside">
    <form
        action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/longo"
        method="post"
        target="popupwindow"
        onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/longo', 'popupwindow')"
        class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
    >
    <label for="bd-email" class="label">Enter your email</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" class="input ~neutral !low bg-neutral-000 mt-2 mb-3 shadow-none max-w-sm block" placeholder="Your email...">
    <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed"></input>
    <button class="button ~urge" type="submit">Subscribe</button>
    </form>
</div>
<hr class="sep h-1">

If the subscription form above doesn't work, you can also join in a [new page](https://buttondown.email/longo).
