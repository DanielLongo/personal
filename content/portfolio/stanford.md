Since September 2020, I've been an undergraduate at [Stanford](https://stanford.edu).

### Work
* **RA at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu)** (October 2020 –). Working on the Tech Team and with the [Election Integrity Partnership](https://www.eipartnership.net/). Studied Wikipedia in a series of two blog posts ([part 1](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/wikipedia-part-one), [part 2](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/wikipedia-part-two)). Built [GoGettr](https://github.com/stanfordio/gogettr). Quoted in [TIME magazine](https://time.com/5930061/wikipedia-birthday/). Built out the core data analysis and ingest tooling.

* **CS 106S Team** (January 2020 –). Helping teach [CS 106S](cs106s.stanford.edu), a supplemental 1-unit add-on to Stanford's famous CS intro class (CS 106A) focusing on programming for social good.

### Organizations
* [**CS+Social Good**](https://cs4good.com/) - Using CS in a way that's socially mindful and equitable.
* [**SymSys Society**](http://www.symsyssociety.org/) - An organization for students who love symbolic systems!

(I want to get involved with more organizations once I'm on campus in-person.)

### Academics

I plan to major in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu), though I'm still undeclared. I like Symbolic Systems because it allows me to complement my love of computer science with coursework in design, philosophy, math, psychology, and linguistics—all of which are fields I'm fascinated with.
