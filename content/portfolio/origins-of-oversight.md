In this research project, [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps) and I processed the entire modern congressional record to study the determinants of foreign policy oversight in Congress. Co-authored with Dr. Kreps. The source code for much of the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/milesmcc/CongressionalDroneOversight).

- Presented by Dr. Kreps at Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, and UC Santa Barbara.
- Co-authored popular opinion piece in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/24/congress-keeps-quiet-on-u-s-drone-policy-and-thats-a-big-problem/).
