I'm interested in the systems of digital freedom, cybersecurity, government, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design. My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/24/congress-keeps-quiet-on-u-s-drone-policy-and-thats-a-big-problem/), the *[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/opinion/facebook-google-apps-data.html#link-6fea96a5), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/trump-other-politicians-celebs-shared-boosted-russian-troll-tweets-n817036), [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/miles-mccain),* [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/author/miles-mccain/), and the [*Nightly News* with Lester Holt](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/wide-range-of-celebrities-accidentally-tweeted-russian-propaganda-during-2016-election-1087414339671). 

The projects I'm most proud of are [PrivacySpy](https://privacyspy.org), [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), my work with Prof. Sarah Kreps, and [a17t](https://a17t.miles.land). And finally, for the obligatory apostrophe soup: PA &rsquo;19, [RC S1 &rsquo;20](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), Stanford &rsquo;24, [EOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character). More details are in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

### Currently

I'm about to head off to Zoom School---erm, I mean college. I'm [not sure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/opinion/letters/coronavirus-college-professors.html) how I feel about that.

### Contact

You can email me at <miles@rmrm.io>. On GitHub, I am [milesmcc](https://github.com/milesmcc); this is where most of my projects live. On Twitter, I am [@MilesMcCain](https://twitter.com/MilesMcCain), but I don't post frequently (I write [micros](/micros/) instead). You can also find me on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=epoch_100), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/epoch_100), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/rmrm), and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/rmrm).

When I have a institutional snail-mail address---like a school mailroom---I will display it here. You know what, though, maybe we should just keep it digital.
