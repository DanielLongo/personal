I'm interested in systems of justice, tech policy, cybersecurity, disinformation, governance, and human-centered design. My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the *Washington Post*, the *New York Times*, *NBC News*, *Foreign Affairs*, Brookings, and the *Nightly News* with Lester Holt. I'm in my first year at Stanford.

Some of the projects I'm most proud of are [PrivacySpy](https://privacyspy.org), [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), [PolitiTweet](https://polititweet.org), my work with [Prof. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps) at her [Tech Policy Lab](https://tpl.as.cornell.edu), my work at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), and [a17t](https://a17t.miles.land). I'm also excited to help teach Stanford's [CS 106S](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106s/) (Coding for Social Good) starting in the Winter of 2021. 

And finally, for the obligatory apostrophe soup: PA &rsquo;19, [RC S1 &rsquo;20](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), [Stanford &rsquo;24](https://stanford.edu/~mccain/), [EOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character). More details are in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

### Currently

I'm currently in Zoom School---erm, I mean college---and am enjoying my courses, even if I'm missing out on much of the college experience. Right now, I'm in New York City.
