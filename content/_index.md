I want to build systems that improve the world---and learn something along the way. My interests include digital freedom, cybersecurity, government accountability, political science, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design. <span class="text-white">And OSINT.</span>

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several major news outlets including the *Washington Post*, the *New York Times, NBC News, Foreign Affairs,* and the *Nightly News* with Lester Holt. My research with [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps) has been presented at Yale, Oxford, Columbia, and Cornell, among other institutions.

I graduated from high school in June 2019. I decided to take a gap year, and will head to Stanford in September 2020.

### Currently

From February 17th to May 4th, I'm in New York City to participate in the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). I'm mostly focusing on lossless compression and cryptography, but what I do on any given day at RC varies widely.

### Contact

You can email me at <miles@rmrm.io>. If you'd like, you can also encrypt your message to [F3C7 8280 DDBF 52A1](https://keybase.io/rmrm) using PGP.

When I have a physical institutional address---like a school mailroom---I will display it here.

On GitHub, I am [milesmcc](https://github.com/milesmcc); this is where most of my projects live. On Twitter, I am [@MilesMcCain](https://twitter.com/MilesMcCain), but I don't post frequently.
