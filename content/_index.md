I'm interested in the systems of digital freedom, cybersecurity, government, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design. My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the _Washington Post_, the _New York Times_, _NBC News_, _Foreign Affairs_, Brookings, and the _Nightly News_ with Lester Holt. 

The projects I'm most proud of are [PrivacySpy](https://privacyspy.org), [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), my work with Prof. Sarah Kreps, and [a17t](https://a17t.miles.land). And finally, for the obligatory apostrophe soup: PA &rsquo;19, [RC S1 &rsquo;20](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), Stanford &rsquo;24, [EOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character). More details are in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

### Currently

I'm about to head off to Zoom School---erm, I mean college. I'm [not sure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/opinion/letters/coronavirus-college-professors.html) how I feel about that. Currently enjoying the final moments of my gap year.

### Contact

You can email me at <hey@miles.land>. On GitHub, I am [milesmcc](https://github.com/milesmcc); this is where most of my projects live. On Twitter, I am [@MilesMcCain](https://twitter.com/MilesMcCain), but I don't post frequently (I write [micros](/micros/) instead). You can also find me on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=epoch_100), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/epoch_100), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/rmrm), and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/rmrm).

When I have a institutional snail-mail address---like a school mailroom---I will display it here. You know what, though, maybe we should just keep it digital.
