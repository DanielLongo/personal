title: "Office Hours"

I maintain a few [open source projects](https://github.com/milesmcc), and I want to be accessible and responsive to everyone who uses my software. Sometimes it's hard to coordinate projects or debug issues via GitHub or email â€” synchronous communication is often just *better*. Sometimes it's just nice to see each others' faces. That's why I host office hours.

Every **Sunday at 11a PT**, I'll hop on a Google Meet call. Anyone is welcome to join. While I anticipate the discussion will center around open source software (and I'll prioritize feature planning and debugging), we can chat about anything. <a href="https://meet.google.com/uyf-euiu-ukp">Join me!</a>
