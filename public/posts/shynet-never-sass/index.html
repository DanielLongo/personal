    <p>Ever since I released <a href="https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet">Shynet</a>, my open source web analytics tool, several people have asked me if I plan to offer some kind of managed version of the service (presumably as some kind of SaaS). While these requests are super exciting and I sympathize with them—not everyone wants to manage their own servers, after all!—it&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m considering. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-is-the-point-of-shynet">Self-hosting is the point of Shynet</h2>
<p>When you use a third-party analytics tool—even one with a strict privacy policy—you&rsquo;re handing your visitors&rsquo; data over to another company. Even if you trust that company to handle the data properly, the data isn&rsquo;t strictly in your control: the company can change ownership, adopt a different business model, or simply go out of business.</p>
<p>In general, if you care about privacy and control, self-hosting your analytics is better for both your visitors and yourself (or your company).</p>
<p>But not all self-hosted analytics tools are equal. Often, they&rsquo;re watered-down versions of paid services (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">Fathom</a>), or weren&rsquo;t designed for self-hosting (e.g., <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/self-hosted-web-analytics-beta">Plausible</a>). Others, like <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, are mature and featureful, but also overly complex (and, if you ask me, a bit of a chore to work with).</p>
<p>The point of Shynet is to build an analytics tool that is self hosted, privacy friendly, and sleek — in that order. These priorities are reflected in Shynet&rsquo;s architecture: there&rsquo;s no Stripe billing integration, no account tiers, and certainly no concept of third-party access. Turning it into a SaaS would conflict with the core purpose of the project.</p>
<h2 id="i-dont-want-your-data">I don&rsquo;t want your data</h2>
<p>On a more practical level, offering Shynet as a SaaS would put me in control of troves of personal data. And <a href="https://www.richie.fi/blog/data-is-a-liability.html">data is a liability</a> from both an ethical and legal perspective. I wouldn&rsquo;t touch it with a ten-foot pole.</p>
<p>If I misconfigure my database and someone breaks in (or something leaks out), I want that to be my problem—and <em>only</em> my problem. If Shynet were a SaaS, it&rsquo;d be all my customers&rsquo; problem, too.</p>
<p>And while I built Shynet with security as a top priority, it&rsquo;s a complex piece of software and almost certainly has holes. If everyone self-hosts Shynet, vulnerabilities take more effort to exploit (after all, an attacker would need to target each instance individually).</p>
<h2 id="there-are-better-tools-elsewhere">There are better tools elsewhere</h2>
<p>I built Shynet to fill a gap I perceived among <em>self-hosted</em> analytics tools—not among analytics tools generally. There&rsquo;s little that Shynet offers that Fathom, Simple Analytics, or Plausible don&rsquo;t (though I do hope to change that over time). After all, Shynet&rsquo;s advantage is that it&rsquo;s designed to be self-hosted; without that, there&rsquo;s little to differentiate it from other analytics offerings.</p>
<p>Analytics is a crowded market. It&rsquo;s ruthlessly competitive. If you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate handing your visitors&rsquo; data over to a third party, there are dozens of companies all fighting for your business. I don&rsquo;t want Shynet to be one of them.</p>
<h2 id="ive-made-up-my-mind">I&rsquo;ve made up my mind</h2>
<p>The fact that some people would be willing to pay for a hosted Shynet offering is endlessly exciting, and it&rsquo;s hard for me to turn those people down. But Shynet is an open source project, not a company, and I&rsquo;d like to keep it that way.</p>
