      <description>I know this is a pretty common mistake, but I just spent 20 minutes debugging a CSS issue before I realized that I was loading the &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; version of the site and not my local development version.
My local development server was being served at https://localhost:1313, but the page I was testing was https://hugo--milesland.netlify.app/. So of course my fixes weren&amp;rsquo;t working &amp;mdash; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t loading the page with the fixes applied!</description>
