      <description>Note: this post is intended to formalize intuitions about Java for students in my AP CS course. This isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be a &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; tutorial! You&amp;rsquo;ll need some existing experience with Java to find this useful.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s write a very simple Java program that prints Hello, world! to the console. This is just about the simplest program imaginable, and you should already feel comfortable with many of these concepts.</description>

      <description>Note: this short post is intended to be a brief introduction to the idea of programming. It&amp;rsquo;s written for students in my AP CS course, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to share it with the world as well.
 A computer program is a list of instructions that a computer can execute. Despite being foundational to the modern world, computers themselves are pretty stupidâ€”so these instructions are explicit and simple. A single instruction might ask for something like add 1 and 2 together or print &amp;quot;Hello, world&amp;quot;.</description>
