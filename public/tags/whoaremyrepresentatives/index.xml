      <description>I recently redesigned WhoAreMyRepresentatives with help from some Politiwatch volunteers. It&amp;rsquo;s just a simple flask app, and setting up some kind of asset pipeline for the CSS felt like overkill, so I imported a17t (my CSS library) from a CDN.
All was well until I released a new version of a17t a few days ago. (You can probably see where this is going.) Emails started to roll in about the site &amp;ldquo;being broken,&amp;rdquo; but because there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many reports and none of my uptime checks were failing, I assumed these were isolated incidents.</description>
