      <description>In this multi-part research project, Dr. Sarah Kreps and I studied how synthetic (AI-generated) disinformation can deceive the public and masquerade as reliable, human-written news.
 Wrote &amp;ldquo;All The News That&amp;rsquo;s Fit to Fabricate: A Study of Synthetic Disinformation&amp;rdquo; with Dr. Kreps and Miles Brundage (forthcoming in the Journal of Experimental Political Science). Co-authored &amp;ldquo;Not Your Father&amp;rsquo;s Bots&amp;rdquo; in Foreign Affairs with Dr. Kreps. Co-authored &amp;ldquo;Taking GPT-2 head-to-head with the New York Times&amp;rdquo; in Brookings&amp;rsquo; TechStream with Dr.</description>

      <description>Politiwatch is a non-profit that technology to promote political accountability, digital rights, and social awareness. I founded Politiwatch as a way to distance myself from some of my more controversial projects. (They weren&amp;rsquo;t that controversial, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable putting my name on them.)
If you find the work I do as Politiwatch impactful, please consider donating.
Politiwatch&amp;rsquo;s sponsors include Google (via their Google for Nonprofits program), Microsoft (though their nonprofit grants program), ProtonMail, and DigitalOcean.</description>
