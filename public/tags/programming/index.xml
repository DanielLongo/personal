      <description>In the fall of 2019, I worked at News Catalyst, building digital tools to empower local news organizations. My work at News Catalyst was supported by the Lenfest Institute.
 Created OpenAlerts, a fully-featured and open source breaking news distribution system intended for local newsrooms. (Because OpenAlerts is open source, I remain on the project. See the Projects section.) Worked with Tyler Fisher to create a management system for the American Press Institute&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Table Stakes&amp;rdquo; program.</description>

      <description>Most of the software I write is open source, and some people have found this software helpful: collectively, my repositories have over 1,000 &amp;ldquo;stars&amp;rdquo; on GitHub. In maintaining and contributing to these projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about effective community building, communication, advertising, and documentation.
Here are some of the open source projects I maintain:
 Shynet a17t PrivacySpy (with Igor Barakaiev) WhyPrivacyMatters LibreNews IEQL  I also make an effort to contribute to other open source projects as well.</description>
