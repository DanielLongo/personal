      <description>Over the past week or so, I’ve been working on building my own simple interpreted programming language. My goal is to learn about language design, Lisp, and systems programming—all while building a language that is fun to use (and maybe, just maybe, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll find it useful for something).
Even though the project has gone well so far (mostly thanks to the safety guarantees of the Rust programming language), I also made a lot of mistakes as I implemented the first version of the interpreter, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll make many more over the course of the project.</description>
