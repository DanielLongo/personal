      <title>Why a17t is meant to be used with Tailwind CSS</title>

      <description>I designed a17t to be used in conjunction with Tailwind CSS. I never use a17t without Tailwind, and I never use Tailwind without a17t.
Why? a17t is an atomic design toolkit. It provides around 30 atomic interface elements&amp;mdash;small, &amp;ldquo;indivisible&amp;rdquo; elements like buttons, form inputs, and headers&amp;mdash;and leaves everything else up to you. The elements themselves are deeply customizable, built with accessibility in mind, and don&amp;rsquo;t come with any built-in spacing.</description>

      <title>I accidentally broke one of my biggest sites because I used a CDN</title>

      <description>I recently redesigned WhoAreMyRepresentatives with help from some Politiwatch volunteers. It&amp;rsquo;s just a simple flask app, and setting up some kind of asset pipeline for the CSS felt like overkill, so I imported a17t (my CSS library) from a CDN.
All was well until I released a new version of a17t a few days ago. (You can probably see where this is going.) Emails started to roll in about the site &amp;ldquo;being broken,&amp;rdquo; but because there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many reports and none of my uptime checks were failing, I assumed these were isolated incidents.</description>
